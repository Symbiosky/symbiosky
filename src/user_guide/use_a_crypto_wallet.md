### 2. Create Your Wallet

When you create a wallet:

1. Set a strong password.
2. You will receive a **Seed Phrase** (12–24 words).

This seed phrase is the **master key** to your wallet.

### 3. Keep Your Seed Phrase Safe (Very Important)

* Write it down on paper.
* Store it in a safe place.
* Never share it with anyone.
* Never store it in email, screenshots, or cloud notes.

👉 Anyone with your seed phrase can steal all your funds.

### 4. Basic Usage

With your wallet you can:

* Receive crypto → Copy your wallet address.
* Send crypto → Enter recipient address and confirm.
* Connect to apps → Click **“Connect Wallet”** on websites.

Always double-check:

* Website URL
* Transaction details before confirming

### 5. Security Best Practices

For better safety:

* Use **one wallet per app/project**.
* This limits risk if one site is malicious.
* Avoid clicking random crypto links.
* Never approve suspicious transactions.
* Disconnect wallet from unknown sites.

This protects you from:

* Phishing websites
* Fake dApps
* Permission abuse

### 6. Important Safety Rule

❌ No legitimate app will EVER ask for your seed phrase.
If someone asks → it is a scam.
