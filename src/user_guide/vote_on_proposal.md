## How to Vote on a Proposal

Voting allows you to evaluate proposals and help decide how SYSKY incentives are distributed.

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Voting Page

Go to:

**Dashboard → Vote on Proposal**

This is where you can submit your vote.

---

## Step 2: What You Need Before Voting

To vote, you must have:

* A **Proposal ID** (the proposal you want to vote on)
* A **Conviction ID** (your locked stake used for voting)
* An **active conviction** (not expired)
* The proposal must still be within its **active voting period**

You cannot vote once the voting window has closed.

---

## Step 3: Submit Your Vote

When voting, you will:

1. Enter the **Proposal ID**
2. Select your **Conviction ID**
3. Choose a **score between 0–10**
4. Submit your vote

Your voting power depends on your conviction level (lock duration).

---

## Step 4: Voting Rules

* You can vote only **once per proposal** using a conviction.
* You cannot use the same conviction to vote twice on the same proposal.
* Higher conviction = stronger voting weight.

## Step 5: Vote Fairly and Responsibly

Always evaluate proposals carefully before voting.

Consider whether:

* The work is genuine and clearly documented
* The contribution benefits the ecosystem
* The effort matches the requested incentives
* Evidence and progress are verifiable

## Step 6: Types of Contributions to Evaluate

Proposals may fall into different categories, such as:

* **Journalism** — reporting, awareness, public communication
* **Research & Academia** — studies, analysis, technical papers
* **Civic Issues** — governance, public engagement, community work
* **Education** — tutorials, guides, knowledge sharing
* **Open Source** — code contributions, tools, infrastructure

Each category may require different evaluation standards.

Remember that if the conviction-weighted mean score is between 5 and 10, the proposal will receive incentives.
