## How to Create a Conviction

Conviction allows you to **lock your SYSKY tokens** to gain stronger voting power when voting on proposals.

The longer you lock your tokens, the more influence your vote will have.

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Conviction Page

Go to:

**Dashboard → Create Conviction**

This is where you can choose how much to stake and how long to lock your tokens.

---

## Step 2: Understand How Conviction Works

Creating a conviction means you are committing your tokens for a period of time.

### Key Concepts

**Time-Locked Stake = Commitment Cost**
When you create a conviction, your tokens are locked and cannot be used elsewhere during the lock period.

**Voting Power Increases with Duration**
The longer you lock your tokens, the higher your voting power. This follows a **conviction curve**, meaning longer commitments give disproportionately stronger influence.

**Opportunity Cost**
Since your tokens are locked, you cannot:

* Transfer them
* Use them in other proposals
* Trade or stake them elsewhere

## Step 3: Choose Your Conviction Level

There are **10 conviction levels**, each with different lock durations.

Higher levels:

* Lock tokens for longer
* Provide more voting power

Lower levels:

* Shorter lock time
* Less voting influence

---

## Step 4: Voting with Conviction

Once created:

* Each conviction gives you **10 vote** for voting different proposals.
* You **cannot vote twice on the same proposal** using the same conviction.

This ensures fair participation while allowing committed users to have stronger influence.

## Step 5: Unlocking Your Tokens

After the conviction period ends you can unlock your token.

Higher conviction levels → Longer unlock periods.

## Important Tips

* Choose lock duration carefully — you cannot withdraw early.
* Higher conviction increases your impact on governance decisions.
* Diversifying across conviction levels can help manage liquidity.
