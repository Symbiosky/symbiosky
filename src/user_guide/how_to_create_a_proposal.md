## Step 1: Post Your Signature in the Thread

[Link](https://symbiosky.vercel.app/bsky/post_signature)

To prevent impersonation, you must post a **cryptographic signature** in your Bluesky thread.

This proves that:

* The wallet submitting the proposal truly belongs to you
* No one can fake your identity

### Signature Format

Your signature must follow this format:

```
did:plc:il4tjezsxcinsljjti457ptz

🔐 Signed by: 0x13db02Ca2f09DC38002dA2f20775707F771dde86
📝 Signature: 0xd0a4a62c87f7c6989944d4e8e1decc94ae1ed16303ee71e4ecc2fc565d8ab0482c03e5387640f432719cb43ad873f674ea47f14be095a5ac6de43960d18738351c
```

This signature:

* Links your Bluesky DID to your wallet address
* Prevents impersonation attacks
* Ensures proposal authenticity

## Step 2: Prepare Your Bluesky Thread

Before submitting a proposal, you must create a **public Bluesky thread** that explains your work.

Your thread should include:

* What you are building or contributing
* Clear description of the work
* Updates or progress (optional but recommended)

You will need to submit the **link to this thread** when creating the proposal.

---

## Step 3: Stake 1 SYSKY Token

To submit a proposal, you must **stake 1 SYSKY token**.

This stake helps:

* Prevent spam proposals
* Ensure serious submissions

---

## Step 4: Submit the Proposal

When creating your proposal, you will need to provide:

* Bluesky thread link
* Your signature (already posted in the thread)
* Required stake (1 SYSKY token)

Once submitted, your proposal will go through evaluation. You will also receive a proposal ID.

---

## Step 5: Proposal Scoring & Rewards

Proposals are scored between **0–10**.

### If Accepted (Score 5–10)

You will receive:

* Your **1 SYSKY stake returned**
* Additional **SYSKY incentives** based on your score

Higher scores → Higher rewards.

---

### If Rejected (Score Below 5)

* Your stake may not be returned.
* You can improve your work and submit again.

---

## Important Tips

* Always post your signature in the Bluesky thread before submitting.
* Make sure your work description is clear and detailed.
* Keep updating your thread to improve your evaluation score.
