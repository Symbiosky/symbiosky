## Tokens Needed to Use Symbiosky

**Note: The mainnet has not been launched yet.**

To use **Symbiosky**, you will need two types of tokens in your wallet:

### 1. Symbiosky Tokens (SYSKY)

**SYSKY** is the main utility token of the Symbiosky platform.

You need SYSKY to:

* Access platform features
* Participate in the ecosystem
* Make transactions within Symbiosky

Make sure your wallet holds enough SYSKY before using the app.

### 2. ETH for Gas Fees

Symbiosky is hosted on the [**Arbitrum Network**](https://docs.arbitrum.io/learn-more/faq), which is a Layer-2 network built on Ethereum.

Because Arbitrum uses Ethereum’s infrastructure:

👉 **ETH is required to pay transaction (gas) fees.**

Every action such as:

* Sending tokens
* Interacting with smart contracts
* Using Symbiosky features

will require a small amount of ETH.

## Why Do I Need ETH on Arbitrum?

ETH is the native currency of Arbitrum.

It is used to:

* Pay gas fees for all transactions
* Secure and power the network
* Process smart contract interactions

Without ETH, your transactions cannot be processed.

## How to Get ETH on Arbitrum

You cannot directly use Ethereum Mainnet ETH on Arbitrum — you must **bridge it**.

### Steps:

1. Get ETH on Ethereum Mainnet (from an exchange or wallet).
2. Go to the official Arbitrum Bridge:
   **[https://portal.arbitrum.io/bridge](https://portal.arbitrum.io/bridge)**
3. Connect your wallet.
4. Transfer ETH from Ethereum → Arbitrum.
5. After bridging, your ETH will appear on the Arbitrum network.

You can also bridge other supported tokens if needed.
