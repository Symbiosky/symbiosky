Trust doesn’t scale. Coordination does. <br> <br>
That’s why we build protocols. <br>

## Trust doesn’t scale

_Trust is human, relational, and expensive._

- Trust works well in _small groups_: families, villages, close teams.
- It depends on:
  - repeated interactions
  - shared norms
  - reputation
  - social punishment

All of that _breaks down with size_.

Why?

- You can’t _know_ millions of people.
- You can’t verify intentions at scale.
- Bad actors become statistically inevitable.
- Enforcement becomes informal → unreliable.

That’s why:

- Villages run on trust
- Nations don’t

Large systems that _pretend_ to run on trust end up relying on:

- elites,
- gatekeepers,
- or coercion.

## Coordination scale

_Coordination is structural, not personal._

Coordination replaces _who you trust_ with _how the system behaves_.

Examples:

- _Markets_ coordinate via prices
- _Traffic_ coordinates via signals
- _Internet_ coordinates via protocols
- _Blockchains_ coordinate via consensus rules

  You don’t trust each participant.
  You trust the _rules + incentives + verification_.

This is why:

- Open-source beats benevolence
- Protocols beat promises
- Systems beat heroes

## Symbiosky is about scaling coordination

Symbiosky is built on this fundamental insight: the future of knowledge work is not about scaling trust — it is about scaling coordination. The platform recognizes that credible information cannot rely on personal reputation alone in a world of billions of participants. Instead, it creates a structured mechanism where communities coordinate funding decisions using conviction voting. 

> Rather than asking “Who do you trust?”, the system asks “How strongly are you willing to commit to your belief?” This shift transforms credibility from a social perception into an economically verifiable signal.


In today’s attention economy, platforms monetize engagement rather than truth. Viral content spreads not because it is credible, but because it captures attention. As a result, independent researchers, journalists, educators, civil societies, advocacy groups struggle to sustain themselves financially, even when their work provides long-term public value. This is not a failure of individuals — it is a failure of coordination. Society lacks mechanisms to collectively fund credibility at scale.

At its core, Symbiosky is not just a platform — it is coordination infrastructure for the credibility economy. It enables communities to collectively decide what deserves support, without relying on centralized gatekeepers or fragile social trust. In a world where information is abundant but credibility is scarce, the ability to coordinate at scale will determine which ideas survive and which fade.
