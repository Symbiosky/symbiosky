## Monetizing Credibility, Not Clicks
### A Conviction Voting Platform for Sustainable Knowledge Work


Symbiosky addresses a fundamental misalignment in how digital platforms compensate knowledge workers. While ad-driven social media rewards viral content and engagement metrics, researchers, journalists, and educators struggle to monetize credible, high-quality work that serves long-term public good.

Built on Bluesky's AT Protocol with over 40 million users, Symbiosky introduces a credibility-first marketplace that uses conviction voting to route funding toward trustworthy contributors. By requiring voters to lock tokens proportional to their confidence level, the system naturally filters short-term manipulation while amplifying sustained, truthful conviction.

Key innovations include:

- *Conviction voting mechanism* that rewards long-term commitment over speculative behavior
- *Merit-based rewards* distributed monthly based on community scoring (1-10 scale)
- *Decay-resistant reputation* that protects active participants while discouraging inactive token hoarding
- *Threshold-based funding* ensuring only well-supported proposals receive rewards
- *Open protocol integration* leveraging Bluesky's decentralized infrastructure

##  Problem Statement

#### The Attention Economy's Broken Incentives

Modern social platforms optimize for engagement metrics that maximize advertising revenue. This creates perverse incentives where:

- Viral misinformation spreads faster than careful fact-checking
- Clickbait headlines outcompete nuanced analysis
- Researchers and educators lack sustainable funding mechanisms
- Quality journalism struggles to compete with sensationalism
- Long-term value creation is undercompensated

The root cause is simple: platforms monetize attention, not credibility. A researcher publishing peer-reviewed findings receives no more financial support than a conspiracy theorist generating viral rage clicks.

#### The Credibility Gap

Knowledge workers face a credibility-monetization gap. While their work may have high epistemic value and long-term social impact, current platforms offer no mechanism to capture this value. Traditional solutions like paywalls, subscriptions, and grants each have limitations:

- *Paywalls* restrict access and reduce impact
- *Subscriptions* require constant content production
- *Grants* involve lengthy applications and institutional gatekeeping
- *Donations* are unpredictable and favor emotional appeals

What's needed is a system that allows communities to directly fund credible work based on sustained conviction rather than momentary attention.


## Solution: The Symbiosky Platform

#### Overview

Symbiosky is a credibility marketplace built on three core principles:

+ *Conviction over clicks:* Voting power scales with token lock duration
+ *Merit over virality:* Rewards based on quality scores, not engagement
+ *Community over algorithms:* Decentralized governance via token holders

The platform enables any user to submit proposals (content, research, journalism, educational materials) and receive monthly funding based on how the community scores their credibility and value.

## The Bluesky Advantage

Symbiosky leverages Bluesky's AT Protocol, which provides:

- *40+ million user base* for immediate network effects
- *Decentralized architecture* ensuring platform resilience
- *Composable feeds* allowing algorithmic choice
- *Open protocol* enabling third-party integrations
- *Credible exit* preventing platform lock-in

This infrastructure allows Symbiosky to focus on governance and incentive design rather than reinventing social networking.
